# Online-Transaction-Fraud-Detection
The objective of this project was to develop a model to identify fraudulent debit card transactions.

# Project Details
* Developed a machine learning model using a hybrid of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify fraudulent transactions.
* Trained and tested the hybrid model on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, achieving an accuracy rate of 85.7%.

# Tools and Technologies
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on debit card transactions. The dataset includes a range of features such as transaction amount, merchant category code, and transaction date and time.

# Future Work
n the future, the model could be further refined to improve its accuracy rate. Additionally, more data could be collected to train the model on a larger and more diverse dataset.
